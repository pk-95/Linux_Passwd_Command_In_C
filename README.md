# Linux_Passwd_Command_In_C
This project helps mimic the 'passwd' command in Linux and is coded in C

## Problem Statement:
Write a program in C to mimic the “passwd” command on Linux. This command will help the
user to change the password. The encryption and decryption of the password is part of this
project. You can use any simple encryption and decryption mechanism. The only argument is
the name of the user for whom the password is being changed. This has to use 2 files passwd
and shadow (You may need to create these 2 files so that the
encrypted password that is stored in the shadow file is as per the encryption/decryption
mechanism you have chosen.
